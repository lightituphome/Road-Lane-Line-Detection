Road Lane Line Detection is a crucial computer vision project for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). It involves identifying and tracking lane markings on the road to ensure safe and accurate vehicle navigation. Using techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, Canny edge detection, region of interest masking, and Hough Transform, this project detects lane lines from real-time video or image data. The resulting system helps vehicles stay within lanes, make informed decisions, and improve overall road safety. This project integrates machine learning and image processing to enhance the capabilities of modern transportation systems.
